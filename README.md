# General signal processing tools (Electrophysiology)

## github@HNXJ

Notable libraries: Scipy - Statsmodel - Plotly - PyMNE - CV2

Draft for python/plotly plotting of electrophysiological signal/data
use arbitrary data (as dict type) for IO

Example of plots; the fucntions will save the plots in HTML format but due to plotly features, you can save a png format from its panel.

### Power spectrum density (Normalized and scaled to max at each channel/frequency)

### Spectral coherence
